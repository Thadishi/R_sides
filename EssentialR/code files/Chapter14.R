## Chapter 14: Productivity Tools in R

# Not much code here, but here is rmd  chunk for document options; uncomment for use in rmd files

# ```{r echo=FALSE}
# knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=4.5,fig.height=3,tidy=TRUE,cache=TRUE,comment="#")
# ```

## Exercises ##
## 1) Take the homework assignment from last chapter and reformat it as an .rmd document (this means convert all the commentary to text, using appropriate headings; code comments can be left as comments). Choose one graph and hide the code that produces it (only for this assignment!), and use inline code to show results from some model or calculation.
